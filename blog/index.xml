      <description>Namaskaram,
In this blog, I will be sharing an amazing story where I used BitVector &amp;amp; Bitwise operators to save myself from writing complex code &amp;amp; also using up a lot of Server Bandwidth.
The problem During my journey as an Android Developer, I came across a use case where I needed to send personalized notifications to my users.
This app was JU eezy, which I developed for our University. I had to send notifications to users based on their profile.</description>

      <description>Notifications alert you to many things on your Android device, including incoming messages, new emails, and calendar events. Notifications work slightly differently for each app, but they&amp;rsquo;re easy to customize.
Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel. For each channel, you can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all notifications in that channel. Then, users can change these settings and decide which notification channels from your app should be intrusive or visible at all.</description>

      <guid>https://thestreamliners.in/blog/location-picker-like-ola-and-uber-in-android/</guid>
      <description>We all come across applications or ideas where we may want users to pick or select their location from maps. From a UX perspective, it is more convenient to pick a location than to manually enter the fields given.
Also, from the developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective getting user location with pinpoint accuracy helps in getting the job done as required concerning location more precisely.
So, how to implement it? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy, you just have to call a few Google Maps APIs, set up location permissions precisely, and create your layout for location picker and that’s all!</description>

We have seen juniors making mistakes while buying a new laptop. They ask for help and people would just send a link for the sake of formality, without doing any research based on the requirements. Please beware of such things because you may regret such a decision in the near future.</description>

      <guid>https://thestreamliners.in/blog/the-reality-of-cse-in-private-colleges-of-india/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The technical education system of CSE in private colleges is very bad. The colleges have opened just to run a business. They are not creating actual Computer Science Engineers. Majority of students end up getting placed in Service based jobs which stops their mental growth. These students do not get jobs CSE students deserve.
Now this problem has been prevailing since a long time now. Situation may have changed a bit but leaving it as is and hoping for better tomorrow will take a lot of time.</description>
