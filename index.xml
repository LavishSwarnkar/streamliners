      <description>We provide extensive training in Android. We guide, mentor and help students become self-sustaining &amp;amp; self-employed Software Engineers (SWE).
 
Our definition of Software Engineer Our definition and qualification of Software Engineer is different. By making you a SWE, we do not mean to make you employable for SWE in FAANG. Instead we speak of it with a much broader perspective.
We believe CSE is meant to apply CS skills to solve real world problems by building solutions.</description>

      <description>Smart Podium   Smart Podium is an IOT based app used to control electrical appliances in the classroom.
  We developed this app during JU Rhythm Hackathon 2019.
  We WON the Hackathon.
  Along with the powerful backend &amp;amp; APIs, the app stood up because of its UI &amp;amp; animations. Have a look :
