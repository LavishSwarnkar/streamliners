      <description>Namaskaram!&#xA;Problem Android provides the following intent launcher APIs:&#xA;Legacy, Deprecated : startActivityForResult() &amp;amp; onActivityResult()&#xA;New: registerForActivityResult()&#xA;Both APIs are tightly coupled with Activity as they are functions of Activity.&#xA;Launching such intents from composables is tricky because of 2 reasons:&#xA;Passing launcher instance to Composable : registerForActivityResult() returns an instance of ActivityResultLauncher. To launch, this instance is required ( like launcher.launch(intent) ). For Composable to be able to launch, launcher needs to passed to it.</description>

      <description>Namaskaram,&#xA;The recent growth in Karobar Easy users made the attendanceUpdater Cloud Function fail! This failure caused inconsistency in the database several times. It took 2 rewrites of the entire cloud function to finally fix the issue. This has been a challenging yet interesting journey for me. So, here I am sharing the incident with you all.&#xA;The attendanceUpdater Cloud Function (ClFn) runs at midnight everyday. It has the following responsibilities :</description>

      <description>Namaskaram,&#xA;In this blog, I will be sharing an amazing story where I used BitVector &amp;amp; Bitwise operators to save myself from writing complex code &amp;amp; also using up a lot of Server Bandwidth.&#xA;The problem During my journey as an Android Developer, I came across a use case where I needed to send personalized notifications to my users.&#xA;This app was JU eezy, which I developed for our University. I had to send notifications to users based on their profile.</description>

      <title>Revoke role access using Firestore Security rules</title>

      <description>Namaskaram,&#xA;Many applications require Role Based access. For example : in an e-commerce project, roles like Admin, Shopkeeper, Agent etc. may exist. Granting and revoking the access manually can be hard &amp;amp; inefficient.&#xA;In this blog, I am sharing an easy &amp;amp; efficient way to grant &amp;amp; revoke role based access in a Firebase app.&#xA;Naive approach Let&amp;rsquo;s say : you have an Admin app where only authorised Admins should be able to login &amp;amp; access the app.</description>

      <description>Laptop plays a very crucial role in a CSE student&amp;rsquo;s life. Just after taking admission in the B.Tech CSE program, students are often in a hurry to buy a laptop. We have seen juniors making mistakes while buying a new laptop. They ask for help and people would just send a link for the sake of formality, without doing any research based on the requirements. Please beware of such things because you may regret such a decision in the near future.</description>

      <title>The reality of CSE in Private colleges of India</title>
      <link>https://thestreamliners.in/blog/the-reality-of-cse-in-private-colleges-of-india/</link>

      <description>Introduction The technical education system of CSE in private colleges is very bad. The colleges have opened just to run a business. They are not creating actual Computer Science Engineers. Majority of students end up getting placed in Service based jobs which stops their mental growth. These students do not get jobs CSE students deserve.&#xA;Now this problem has been prevailing since a long time now. Situation may have changed a bit but leaving it as is and hoping for better tomorrow will take a lot of time.</description>
