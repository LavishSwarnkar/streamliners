      <description>A Splash Screen is a screen which appears when you open an app on your mobile device. Sometimes it’s referred to as a launch screen or startup screen and shows up when your app is loading after you&amp;rsquo;ve just opened it.&#xA;When the loading is finished, you’ll be taken to a more functional screen where you can complete actions.&#xA;Splash screens appear on your screen for a fleeting moment – look away and you might miss them.</description>
