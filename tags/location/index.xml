      <description>We all come across applications or ideas where we may want users to pick or select their location from maps. From a UX perspective, it is more convenient to pick a location than to manually enter the fields given.
Also, from the developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective getting user location with pinpoint accuracy helps in getting the job done as required concerning location more precisely.
So, how to implement it? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy, you just have to call a few Google Maps APIs, set up location permissions precisely, and create your layout for location picker and thatâ€™s all!</description>
